# Mina

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sariina/mina.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sariina/mina)

Mina is saves API server responses to disk and serves them with its own HTTP server. Some use cases include:

- working with the API server when you or the server is offline
- each request costs money
- API server forces rate limits 
- etc.

## Install

    go get -u github.com/sariina/mina

## Example

Start a mina server for Github API on port 8080:

    mina -addr=:8080 -target=https://api.github.com

In your client/broweser/app, instead of sending a request to

    https://api.github.com/users/sariina

send it to

    http://localhost:8080/users/sariina

Voila, the same response. The response is saved to your disk.
Your app will think that you are using Github API even when you are offline.
